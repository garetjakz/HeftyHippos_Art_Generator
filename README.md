# HeftyHippos Art Generator
Source Code Changes to hashlips_art_engine-main Code
Adds in:
* DNA Based on layer names (used later for stuff)
* Allows creation of set NFTs (eg. founder nfts for 1 and 2) using DNA structure to ensure it won't generate a duplicate.
* Allows dropping of 1/1 NFTs throught a project using DNA so no duplicates generated. eg. every 400 randomly put in a 1/1.
